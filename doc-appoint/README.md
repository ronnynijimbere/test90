## Introduction
The Vital Visit Doctor Appointment Booking System is a web application designed to streamline the process of booking appointments with doctors. Patients can browse through a list of doctors and book appointments. Doctors can view their schedules, manage their availability, and approve or reject appointment requests. Admins can manage the list of doctors and users, approve or reject doctor applications, and block users if needed. The system aims to simplify the appointment booking process for patients, doctors, and admins, making it more efficient and user-friendly.

## System Architecture
### Web Stack
- **Frontend**: The frontend is developed using [Create React App (CRA)](https://create-react-app.dev/), a popular tool for building single-page React applications. It provides a robust setup with a great developer experience.
  - **Motivation**: React is chosen for its component-based architecture, which promotes reusability and ease of maintenance. CRA simplifies the setup and configuration process, allowing for faster development.
  - **Styling**: The app is styled using [Ant Design](https://ant.design/), a powerful UI framework that provides a wide range of pre-designed components and a consistent design language. It is chosen for its comprehensive library, ease of use, and professional design.

- **Backend**: The backend is built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/), a flexible web application framework for Node.js.
  - **Motivation**: Node.js is chosen for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which makes it suitable for I/O-heavy applications like ours. Express simplifies routing and middleware integration, making it easier to build scalable and maintainable APIs.

- **Database**: The application uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) for data storage, managed via [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
  - **Motivation**: MongoDB's schema-less design provides flexibility in storing diverse types of data and makes it easier to evolve the database schema as the application grows.

   - As an admin, I want to block users if necessary to prevent misuse of the platform.

## Comparison with Existing Solutions
Currently, there are several web applications for booking doctor appointments, such as Zocdoc and Practo. However, our solution aims to be:
- **Simpler**: A more straightforward user interface focused on ease of use.
- **Cost-effective**: Potentially cheaper for smaller clinics or individual doctors.
- **Customizable**: Easy to add new features and customize according to specific needs.

## Deployment

The application will be deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for both the frontend and backend.

- **Motivation**: Vercel provides seamless deployment for React applications with built-in support for serverless functions and Node.js applications. It offers an easy-to-use platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for deploying and managing applications.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Frontend (Vercel)**:
   - Connect the GitHub repository to Vercel.
   - Configure the build settings to use `npm run build`.
   - Deploy the application.

2. **Backend (Vercel)**:
   - Connect the GitHub repository to Vercel.
   - Configure the project to recognize serverless functions or API routes as the backend.
   - Configure environment variables for the database connection and JWT secret in Vercel.
   - Deploy the application.
